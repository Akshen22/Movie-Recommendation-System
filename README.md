# Movie-Recommendation-System

A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity

*Here we gonna work on 2 platforms, which are namely: Jupyter Notebook & PyCharm (download the code, given above)

*For Dataset kindly download both the csv files from the below given link;

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv

*Will also need an API, so for that kindly create one from: https://www.themoviedb.org/

Steps to create API;

1. Once you are landed on tmdb website (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

2. Go to settings & later click on API & create one for yourself.

3. Once done save your respective API key somewhere in your device, as will move ahead will use the API key.

*Moving forward, open your jupyter notebook & kindly make a movie recommder system folder!

Later add: movie recommender system.ipynb & both .csv files.

Now run the: movie recommender system.ipynb

Once exeuted, you will see a few .pkl files in your movie recommder system folder, don't worry about that it gonna help us to land our website

Time for: app.py file which one should execute opening pycharm and creating a new project; install streamlit, writing pip install streamlit in the pycharm terminal

Now copy paste all the .pkl file from jypter folder to here, later type: streamlit run app.py in the pycharm terminal, click on that ip address (simsilar to this: http://192.168.29.41:8501/ gonna come)
